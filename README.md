# OFM-4-MGL 

This a utility which makes tiled slippy maps available for use in the MGL line of EFIS for aeronautical navigation.
Specifically, it is intended for Openflightmaps to be imported to MGL but it can work with any other standard slippy
map server following the standard convention of tile naming.
